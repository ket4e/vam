///   <para>Object encapsulating the duration of a single renderpass that contains one or more subpasses.
///
/// The RenderPass object provides a new way to switch rendertargets in the context of a Scriptable Rendering Pipeline. As opposed to the SetRenderTargets function, the RenderPass object specifies a clear beginning and an end for the rendering, alongside explicit load/store actions on the rendering surfaces.
///
/// The RenderPass object also allows running multiple subpasses within the same renderpass, where the pixel shaders have a read access to the current pixel value within the renderpass. This allows for efficient implementation of various rendering methods on tile-based GPUs, such as deferred rendering.
///
/// RenderPasses are natively implemented on Metal (iOS) and Vulkan, but the API is fully functional on all rendering backends via emulation (using legacy SetRenderTargets calls and reading the current pixel values via texel fetches).
///
/// A quick example on how to use the RenderPass API within the Scriptable Render Pipeline to implement deferred rendering:
///
/// The RenderPass mechanism has the following limitations:
/// - All attachments must have the same resolution and MSAA sample count
/// - The rendering results of previous subpasses are only available within the same screen-space pixel
///   coordinate via the UNITY_READ_FRAMEBUFFER_INPUT(x) macro in the shader; the attachments cannot be bound
///   as textures or otherwise accessed until the renderpass has ended
/// - iOS Metal does not allow reading from the Z-Buffer, so an additional render target is needed to work around that
/// - The maximum amount of attachments allowed per RenderPass is currently 8 + depth, but note that various GPUs may
///   have stricter limits.</para>
